**3. Methodology: Data Science Approach**
_**3.1 Data Preparation**_
- **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical features to convert text labels into a binary format
- **Selective Scaling:** Standard Scaling was applied to continuous numerical features
- **Data Splitting & Resampling:** Split data into training & testing sets, the SMOTE method was applied to the training data to create a balanced distribution.
  
_**3.2 Modeling & Evaluation**_
Probabilistic & rules-based model
